            Splayed in his elastic g-web, Case watched the other passengers as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi
            stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket. No light but the muted purring of the car’s floor. The semiotics
            of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark. They floated in
            the coffin for Armitage’s call. It was chambered for .22 long rifle, and Case would’ve preferred lead azide
            explosives to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall of a
            heroin factory. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
            cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.
